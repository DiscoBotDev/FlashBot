Giveaway bot for the Flash discord

This is a bot I created for the Flash discord to record wallet addresses for Flash giveaways onto a Google spreadsheet. 

Features two commands.

Flash!Name and Flash!Token

Flash!Name checks to see if your name is in the spreadsheet record.

Flash!Token records your name and wallet in the spreadsheet record.
